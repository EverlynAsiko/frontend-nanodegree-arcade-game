#Classic Arcade Game
===============================

This is a front end nanodegree udacity project.

**How it works**

When the window loads so does the game canvas. The enemy bugs and rock start moving immediately. The player can move across block by block. 
If the player and the bug meet at the same block a collision occurs and this reverts the player back to initial position. When the player reaches the water point the game is won and a modal appears.

_Added functionality_
The player gets a congratulations modal.
Also, their is a pause functionality added to the game.

More functionality will be added as practising continues.

**Happy crossing**
